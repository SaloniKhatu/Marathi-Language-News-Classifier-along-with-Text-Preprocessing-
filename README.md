# Marathi-Language-News-Classifier-along-with-Text-Preprocessing-
A text classifier application developed using Python for the Marathi regional language. Also include data preprocessing steps for Marathi words.
Text classification, a common task in Natural Language Processing, is used to classify sentiments, food reviews, and much more. 
The development of information technology has led to the collection of a large number of text documents. Over the last decade, 
the use of regional language on online platforms has increased tremendously. With the increased adaptation of regional languages in the digital era, 
the need for classification of text in regional languages has also increased. Mostly, researchers work on English text documents. 
Today, there are millions of documents in Indian regional languages. Marathi is one of the most prominent languages spoken in India. 
As one of the 22 constitutional languages, Marathi is spoken by approximately 83 million people. Marathi is an Indo-Aryan language. 
It is mostly spoken by people from Maharashtra. However, research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches for Marathi text has not received much attention. 
Being a morphologically rich language; the classification of Marathi text documents is a difficult task. 
Marathi uses a variant of the Devanagari script in its written form. The Marathi root word consists of many inflected morphological variants; 
which makes it difficult to extract features from Marathi documents. Thus, manual classification of these documents is a costly and time-consuming task. 
Automatic classification can help in better management and retrieval of these documents.
